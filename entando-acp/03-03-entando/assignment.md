Now that the Tableau Packaged Business Capabilities has been installed, the included components are available in the platform.
This PBC contains a micro frontend that displays the S&P Returns and Economic Indicators.

In order to use it, we need to first define the page which will host it.

In the Left Sidebar, Click on **Pages** > **Management**

Here you see a list of pages that represents the page tree of your application.
Click **Add** in the bottom-right to create a new page.

Enter the following required details:

In the **Info Section** fill the **Title:** with the **S&P Tableau**.
Then, in the page tree, select the page emplacement by clicking on **Home**, it should be highlighted in blue.

In the **Page Groups** section change **Owner group** from **Administrator** to **Free Access**

Finally, in the **Settings** section choose the **1-2 Columns** **Page Template**.

Once all these fields are filled, click on the **Save and Design** button at the bottom, the Designer is displayed.

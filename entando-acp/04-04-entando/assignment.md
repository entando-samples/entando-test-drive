As a Composer, designing a page means selecting the components and placing them at the right places.
We can do it by dragging & dropping elements from the **Widgets** tab, in the right Sidebar.

You can drop them into the dotted grey sections or frames.

From the right sidebar, scroll down and expand the **Page** menu,
drag & drop the **Logo widget** inside the **Logo** section on the page.

From the right sidebar, scroll down and expand the **User** menu,
drag & drop the **Tableau Sample Widget** inside the highlighted grey **Frame1** on the page.

Click on **Publish** at the bottom.

Click **View Published Page** at the top right to see your page live.

You should see your page displaying the S&P Returns and Financial Indicators.

The Content widget helps us to add more consistency to the Dashboard by highlighting indicators and providing some analysis.

Scroll down and expand the **CMS** menu,
drag & drop the **Content Widget** inside the grey **Frame2** on the page.

You are automatically asked to select the Content to display in this Widget. Here, select an existing one by clicking on
the **Add existing Content** button, then click on the checkbox aside the content named **Sample - About us**.
Click on **Choose** to validate your choice.

To finalize the content selection, click on the **Save** button.

Back to the Page Designer, we have to publish the page and check that it’s working as expected.

Click on the **Publish** button at the bottom.

Click **View Published Page** at the top right to see your page live.

Congratulations! You’ve completed this challenge.

You’ve created a Dashboard page using an existing component and creating a new one to compose the page.

Now let the Consumer use the application.

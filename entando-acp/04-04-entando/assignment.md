**ADD TABLEAU PBC INTO YOUR APPLICATION**

**STEP 1:**

As a Composer, designing a page means selecting components and placing them into pages. We do this by dragging & dropping elements from the tab on the right sidebar into the grey highlighted sections of the page on the left.

From the right sidebar,**<u> scroll down and expand the Page menu</u>**,

then, **<u>drag & drop the LOGO WIDGET inside the Logo section onto the page</u>**.

From the right sidebar, **<u>scroll down and expand the User menu</u>**,

then, **<u>drag & drop the Tableau Sample Widget inside the highlighted grey Frame1 on the page</u>**,

then, **<u>click the SAVE button</u>** within the configuration window.

Next, **<u>click the Publish button </u>** at the bottom, and then **<u>click View Published Page</u>** at the top right to view your page.  You should now see your page displaying the S&P Returns and Financial Indicators.

**STEP 2:**

We will now add additional content to the page to add additional information to this Tableau dashboard highlighting indicators and providing some analysis.

**<u>Scroll down and expand the CMS menu</u>**,

then, **<u>drag & drop the Content Widget inside the grey Frame2 onto the page</u>**.

You will be asked to select the content to display in this widget. Select an existing one by **<u>clicking on the Add existing Content button</u>**,

then, **<u>click on the checkbox next to "Sample - About us"</u>**.

then, **<u>click on "Choose</u>**",

then, **click on "Save"** to finalize the selection.

Next, let's publish the page and check that it’s working as expected.

**<u>Click on Publish</u>** at the bottom,

then, **<u>click on View Published Page</u>** at the top right to see your page live.

Congratulations! You’ve completed this challenge.

You’ve created a Dashboard page using an existing component and added a web content article to the same page.

Next, let's view the application from the Consumer role. **<u>Click Check</u>** at the bottom right to move to the next challenge.

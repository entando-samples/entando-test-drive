    **APP BUILDER OVERVIEW:**

    Entando is an **Application Composition Platform**.  It allows teams to compose apps from a set of modules and web content.   Entando enables teams to organize work into 4 roles (individuals perform one or more roles). They are: 
  
    - **_Creators_** (developers who build the individual modules)
    - **_Curators_** (individuals who manage a library of components)
    - **_Composers_** (individuals who assemble components into applications)
    - **_Consumers_** (individuals who either use or manage application configurations, e.g., users/roles/content mgmt)

    Next, we will demonstrate the role of an application **Composer** and walk through the steps to build your first composed application.

**APP BUILDER OVERVIEW**

For this challenge, all modules, content, and page layouts have been prebuilt by Creators.  We will assemble them into a single application as shown in this example:

Entando's low code **App Builder** is a web interface that allows Composers to define pages, users, roles, access policies, and web content, it also enables composers to assemble content and modules onto those pages.  

Let's begin this tutorial by using Entando's OOTB wizard to provide a basic overview of the **App Builder**'s features.   

In the web window **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">enter</span>**:  

_Username_: **admin**

_Password_: **adminadmin**

(Note: After your 1st login, it will ask you to create a new password.  **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Please enter one now</span>**.)

Once youâ€™re logged in, a pop-up wizard will appear with instructions for creating your first web page.

Complete the steps then click **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">CHECK</span>** within this window to continue to your next challenge.

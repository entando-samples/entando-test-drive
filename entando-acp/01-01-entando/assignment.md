    Entando is an Application Composition Platform(ACP). It enables Enterprises to quickly build Business Value for their users (Consumers). In addition to the Consumer persona, there are three other main personas responsible for enabling this business value. They are the Creator, Curator, and Composer.

    *In the Track, you are the Composer!*

    Meaning that you pull the necessary building blocks and integrate them. But, all of this is possible only in the Application Composition Platform!


    ## We’ll walk you through the process of doing so, and help you master it!
